# TheMinecraftPlugin

TheMinecraftPlugin is a steadily growing, modular PaperMC plugin that brings many familiar server features into one consistent, well-structured system. It isn’t finished and it isn’t meant to replace the entire plugin ecosystem, but the aim is clear:  **a unified framework where core server features feel like they belong together instead of being stitched from a dozen different places.**

The development of this project is intentionally open and community-driven, with a focus on keeping communication clear and making it easy for anyone to follow what’s happening. Suggestions, bug reports, and feature ideas are encouraged, and the hope is that the project grows in a direction shaped by real server owners and players rather than rigid plans that ignore how people actually use it in practice.

Features are added gradually and built on top of shared systems, allowing the plugin to improve in small, steady steps without forcing server owners through complicated changes every update. The goal is long-term familiarity, where administrators know what to expect, where configuration makes sense across different modules, and where improvements carry over naturally as the plugin evolves.

Even though this is a hobby project, it’s designed with the intention of being genuinely useful to others, whether someone needs just one feature or several pieces of the larger system. TheMinecraftPlugin will continue to grow as time allows, shaped by feedback, informed by real usage, and built in a way that welcomes collaboration instead of making it complicated.

## 📖 About the Project
TheMinecraftPlugin started as my personal learning project years ago — the thing I rebuilt every time I learned something new about Java, game server architecture, web development, or backend systems. I’ve scrapped and rewritten this plugin multiple times, each version cleaner and more stable than the last. This release marks the beginning of the **final, long-term version**. It’s not complete yet, but its **foundation is finally right** — modular, future-proof, and designed to grow with the server ecosystem rather than fight against it.

I’m sharing it publicly because:
- I want others to be able to learn from the code the same way I learned from the plugins before me  
- I believe servers shouldn’t have to juggle 30+ plugins when one well-made system can handle it  
- Open development makes quality better  
- And honestly… it’s fun to build something big and see people use it

This plugin is open-source, collaborative, and constantly evolving.

## ⚖️ Friendly License & Usage Terms

TheMinecraftPlugin is shared openly so people can learn from it, use it, and build on it — but it also needs clear boundaries to protect the project, the contributors, and the work that goes into it.

These guidelines exist to keep things fair for everyone.

### ✔️ Allowed
You are welcome to:
- Use this plugin on any server, including monetized servers  
- Modify the plugin for your own server or personal experiments  
- Learn from the codebase  
- Build addons, extensions, or integrations  
- Contribute fixes, improvements, or new ideas  
- Share the plugin with others, as long as proper credit remains intact  

### ❌ Not Allowed
To protect the project and its contributors, you may **not**:
- Claim the plugin, its code, or its features as your own work  
- Rebrand, rename, or re-upload it as a separate project  
- Sell the plugin itself, or include it inside a paid plugin/service  
- Package or reuse parts of the code in commercial products  
- Sell features **powered directly by this plugin** (e.g., selling access to features it provides out-of-the-box)  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is not meant to restrict normal server monetization.  
> Things like donor ranks, cosmetics, or perks from other plugins are perfectly fine.  
> The restriction applies only to reselling *this* plugin or the features *created by this plugin*.

### 🤝 Special Circumstances
If you have a use that falls outside these rules — commercial integrations, custom distributions, large-scale network usage, or anything unique — just reach out.  
I try to be flexible, and most reasonable requests can be discussed.

### 🧩 Contributions
By contributing code, documentation, or other work, you agree that your contribution becomes part of the project under these same terms unless we discuss something different beforehand.

This keeps the project consistent, legally safe, and fair to everyone involved.
